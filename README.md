Recommended Route - Uses a predicted probability to show you the best route to hunt on

----Notes----
* Note that probabilities are not publically known and the values used are just educated guesses but will still allow comparisons between routes
* 1 in 100 does not guarantee an encounter in exactly 100 encounters
* Importing your encounters currently does not load all routes, so you will need to spam click recommended route a few times to reset the maths
